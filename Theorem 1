Lemma (Pumping Lemming). \label{pumping}

:   Let $L$ be a regular language. Then there exists an integer $p \geq 1$ called the "pumping length" which depends only on $L$, such that every string $w \in L$ of length at least $p$ can be divided into three substrings $w = xyz$ such that the following conditions hold:

    - $|y| \geq 1$
    - $|xy| \leq p$
    - $xy^n z \in L$, for all $n \geq 0$.

    That is, the non-empty substring $y$ occurring within the first $p$ characters of $w$ can be "pumped" any number of times, and the resulting string is always in $L$.
