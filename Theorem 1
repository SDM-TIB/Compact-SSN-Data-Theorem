**Theorem 1** Given *G* and *G′* such that *G′* is a factorized RDF graph of *G*.
LetQandQ′be SPARQL querieswhereQ′is a rewritten query ofQoverG′generated by Algorithm 2. The problem of evaluatingQ′againstG′is in: (1) PTIME if queryQhas only AND andFILTER operators; (2) NP-complete if queryQhas ex-pressions with AND, FILTER, and UNION operators;and (3) PSPACE-complete for OPTIONAL graph pat-tern expressions
ProofWe proceed with a proof by contradiction. As-sume that complexity ofQ′is higher thanQ. Then,UNION or OPTIONAL operators not included inQareadded toQ′. However, Algorithm 2 only changes triplepatterns overGby triple patterns againstG′. Addition-ally, Algorithm 2 includes new JOINs (AND operator).However, adding AND or FILTER operators does notaffect the complexity of the problem of evaluatingQ′overG′, and contradicting the fact that the complexityofQ′is higher thanQ
